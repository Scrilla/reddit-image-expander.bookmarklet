Reddit Image Expander Bookmarklet
=================================

This is a simple version that just loads direct image links in a style similar to the RES "view all images" feature.

Types loaded - jpeg, png, gif, jpeg

Imgur.com images are attempted to be loaded, but albums, galleries and multi-image links are not currently supported.

Hotlinking flickr, 500px, gyfcat, etc is currently not supported if the link is not a direct image link.

Initially based on adding functionality to this script:
